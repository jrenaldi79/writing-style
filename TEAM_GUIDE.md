# Writing Style Clone — Team Guide

## What Is This?

**Writing Style Clone** is a tool that teaches AI to write like *you*.

Instead of getting generic AI-generated text, you'll have a personalized writing assistant that matches your actual voice across different contexts—whether you're sending an all-hands email, coaching a direct report, or posting on LinkedIn.

## Why Use It?

| The Problem | The Solution |
|-------------|--------------|
| AI writing sounds generic and robotic | AI learns *your* specific patterns and phrases |
| You write differently for different audiences | AI recognizes your distinct "personas" and switches between them |
| Editing AI output to sound like you takes forever | AI gets it right the first time |

---

## What You'll Get

After ~30 minutes of setup, you'll have a **personal writing assistant** in ChatWise that:

- Knows your greeting and sign-off patterns
- Matches your tone (formal vs. casual)
- Uses your actual phrases and vocabulary
- Understands when to be brief vs. detailed
- Switches voice based on context (team email vs. 1:1 vs. LinkedIn)

## How It Works (The Simple Version)

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   ANALYZE   │  →   │   DISCOVER  │  →   │    WRITE    │
│             │      │             │      │             │
│ AI reads    │      │ AI finds    │      │ AI writes   │
│ your emails │      │ your voice  │      │ like you    │
│ & LinkedIn  │      │ patterns    │      │             │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
```

1. **Analyze** — AI reads batches of your sent emails and LinkedIn posts
2. **Discover** — AI identifies your distinct writing styles ("personas")
3. **Write** — You get a custom AI assistant that writes in your voice
